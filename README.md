As the internet becomes bigger and applications become more complex, the "simple" front end we all know and love is slowly dying. It still works well for certain types of websites, but the user (and the developers) are getting more and more accustomed to a more complex, but more extendable, way of building things.

The purpose of this project is to build a React front end that interfaces with a Django Rest Framework back end running on the same machine.

The GhostPost Machine™ is a website where people can anonymously post Boasts or Roasts of whatever they want. Like Twitter, there is a character limit: 280 characters. We are deliberately not dealing with logins, as that is outside the scope of the project (and beyond our time constraints). 

 

Your Task
Build a back end API using Django Rest Framework. This API will connect to your front end React app and serve the required data.

Back end:

Model(s) for boasts and roasts with appropriate attributes as derived from other requirements
GET, and POST endpoints for boasts and roasts
POST endpoints for voting on boasts and roasts
